# Personal website

A modern portfolio website built with Vue and Vue Router, designed to showcase projects and personal information through a clean and intuitive interface. With smooth client-side routing and responsive design, it offers a seamless browsing experience across devices.

Styled with a minimalist aesthetic and built for performance, the site emphasizes clarity and structure. Whether you're viewing detailed project pages or learning more about the creator, the design stays out of the way letting the work speak for itself.
If you want to locally play with it you can clone the directory and run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Otherwise you can checkout the web site at the following [link](https://portfolio-two-ecru-43.vercel.app/).
